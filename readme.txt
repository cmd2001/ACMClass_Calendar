Feature:

A simple calendar with event tags.

Developed with flask framework.

Usage:

First, initialize the database by initdb.py.

If you want to add a event, just execute addTask.py and enter event data.

Visit /month/<int:year>/<int:month> to get overviews of events in that month.

You can click on the link of an event to get more information about it.

Known Bugs:

Hyperlinks cannot be clicked on Mac OS X platform. (a confusing bug)

The user interface is still extremely ugly since this project is still under heavy development.
